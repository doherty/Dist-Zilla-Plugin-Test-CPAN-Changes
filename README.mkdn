# NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::CPAN::Changes - release tests for your changelog

# VERSION

version 0.012

# SYNOPSIS

In `dist.ini`:

    [Test::CPAN::Changes]

# DESCRIPTION

This is an extension of [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles), providing the
following file:

    xt/release/cpan-changes.t - a standard Test::CPAN::Changes test

See [Test::CPAN::Changes](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::CPAN::Changes) for what this test does.

## Alternate changelog filenames

[CPAN::Changes::Spec](https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Changes::Spec) specifies that the changelog will be called 'Changes' -
if you want to use a different filename for whatever reason, do:

    [Test::CPAN::Changes]
    changelog = CHANGES

and that file will be tested instead.
